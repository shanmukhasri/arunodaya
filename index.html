        <h2>Organization’s Motto</h2>
        <p>Our motto is to bring awareness to society regarding the difficulties faced by special children due to various socio-economic reasons. We extend our hands to support them in every possible way to lead their lives with dignity. We give voice to their rights and become their wings, allowing them to fly high and achieve their dreams. We see them as differently-abled, not disabled, because they are Special.</p>

        <h2>Chairperson’s Voice</h2>
        <p>Life is so beautiful and precious. Like how day and night come along one after the other, in life, beautiful times and bad times come along. We shouldn’t lose hope and faith in ourselves to overcome our bad times to see a beautiful tomorrow. One thing is for sure: whatever happens, happens for a good cause.</p>

        <p>On this note, I would like to share one of my personal experiences during a dark period in my life. Many years ago, my life took an unexpected turn with the birth of my son. Like any other parents, we were enjoying the heights of happiness with our newborn baby, only to suddenly learn from the doctors that the baby was not typical. He was diagnosed with “Cerebral Palsy” and declared “Partially Sightless” with “Nystagmus” and “Corneal Opacity.” At 19 years of age, my ordinary world suddenly tumbled into darkness. Not understanding what the doctors were saying, I struggled with the unfamiliar terms. Each passing day revealed two harsh realities: the baby’s condition and the societal stigma that came with it. Sadly, my son’s condition deteriorated, and he is no longer with us today. However, he showed me the purpose of my life and paved the path for my future, leading to the establishment of “Arunodaya Mano Vikasa Kendram” in 1994 in association with AWARD (Association for Welfare and Comprehensive Rural Development).</p>

        <p>It took months for me to recover, and during that time, I encountered several other families facing the same pain. I noticed a severe lack of awareness about disabilities in the public and a troubling social stigma toward these special children. Driven by a desire to support special children and their families, I resumed my studies after marriage, joined the Thakur Hari Prasad Institute of Research and Rehabilitation for the Mentally Handicapped in Rajahmundry, and completed a diploma course in Mental Retardation (D.S.E - MR). Over the years, I continued updating myself on scientific approaches in this field by attending seminars organized by institutions like the National Institute for the Mentally Handicapped, Secunderabad, and others. My only motto here is to support special children and their families so they do not experience the pain I once endured. "Sarve Jana Sukhinobhavanthu."</p>
